PlanetKit is a project aimed at creating a toolkit for making interactive virtual worlds. I'm writing it in the Rust programming language, which I'm finding delightful to work with, and a great fit for the task.

This week I'm going to allow the player to remove blocks from my voxel world.

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="/videos/mining-low.mp4">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player!
</video>

Yes, it's getting a bit tedious to look at that same scene. I'm planning to freshen it up a bit before my next post, with things like a much larger world, and a new random seed each time.


## What do I need to cover?

- why does the video above show slow updating?
- the easy bits
- borrow checker woes
- what I did to get around it
- other options I considered that weren't viable.


## What's next?

TODO:

- adding more types


As always, the source for everything I'm talking about here is up in the [_planetkit_ repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffparsons/planetkit).
