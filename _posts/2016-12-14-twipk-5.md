PlanetKit is a project aimed at creating a toolkit for making interactive virtual worlds. I'm writing it in the Rust programming language, which I'm finding delightful to work with, and a great fit for the task.

It's been nearly a month since I last posted here, so I'm going to drop the pretense of it being a weekly blog. The main reason it's been so long is that I've been chipping away at a few unglamorous bits and pieces. So, alas, no pretty screenshots this week.


## What have I been up to?

A lot of my commits recently have been boring housekeeping:

- Split draw code out into its own module.
- Un-bundled meshes from Pipeline State Objects so I can share the PSOs across multiple meshes. This is more efficient, because it avoids loading a new shader program if multiple meshes could re-use the same program.
- Emit a separate mesh per chunk in preparation for dynamically loading/unloading chunks.
- Turned PlanetKit into a library crate.

I also added some basic structured logging using the `slog` crate. [Zbigniew Siciarz recently wrote about slog](https://siciarz.net/24-days-rust-structured-logging/) in his "24 days of Rust" series.

Some slightly more interesting changes were:

- I made a token start on exposing "simple" version of things. I haven't settled on what the API for this should look like, but the premise is that every more complex construction should have a quick-and-dirty simple version to get up and running, that still leaves open a migration path to a more complex version without needing to start from scratch.

- Token start on `CellDweller`. This is a component type for all entities that exist in and move between cells on a globe grid. (Similarity to the alternative metal project "Celldweller" unintentional.) (TODO: lead into what's next)

- I implemented `specs` for rendering and input handling. (See below.) Learn a lot from yasteroids: send encoders between render and main. TODO: link to yasteroids.


## Yasteroids

Yasteroids is particularly interesting to me because it uses gfx and specs, both of which I'm using now for PlanetKit.

TODO: write about some of the design of how they use:

- render system
  - encoder channel
- input handling
- specs


## What's next?

TODO

Next up I'm going to start building a simple game on top of this. Yes, that's what I said next week. I also said it'd take a little while to get started, because of the need to explore a few things. Well, I've explored them, now. Let's go!

Stay tuned for more hexagonal fun!

As always, the source for everything I'm talking about here is up in the [_planetkit_ repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffparsons/planetkit).
