PlanetKit is a project aimed at creating a toolkit for making interactive virtual worlds. I'm writing it in the Rust programming language, which I'm finding delightful to work with, and a great fit for the task.

Over the last few weeks, I made the changes needed to represent large worlds. This broke down into two main tasks:

- Dynamically unload parts of the world that aren't needed.
- Represent transformations of physical things relative to some parent object, so that we can have arbitrarily large worlds without losing precision. More on this below.

Here's what it looks like:

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="/videos/running-around2-low.mp4">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player!

That planet has the same radius as Earth, so you won't even be able to see the curvature of the "horizon" given that it's currently mere meters away.


## Hierarchical coordinate system

These same changes also make it just as easy to represent universes at the scale of our own, for no extra fee! Unfortunately I don't even have an example with multiple globes yet, so you'll just have to take my word on that for now.


The interesting change at the heart of all the above is roughly this:

- ...TODO


## What's next?

I'm going travelling, so I won't be working on PlanetKit for the next several weeks.

When I get back, my plan is to...

- Make the camera's movement smooth.
- Add an object to the world that lets you win the game by walking on it.
- Load/save worlds, including a starting point for the player.

As always, the source for everything I'm talking about here is up in the [_planetkit_ repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffparsons/planetkit).
