In my last post I used Perlin noise (now switched over to simplex noise) to create some basic terrain. Here's the lumpy blob we ended up with at the end:

Let's see what I said I was going to tackle next:

> My next move will be to turn this into a proper voxmap of (mostly) hexagonal prisms, à la Minecraft. Or, you know, I might lie about that again and do something else instead.

Ok, then. Let's do it! Errr, the voxels bit, I mean---not the lying.

The first thing I did was to change what I store about the globe from being a 2D array of height values (a heightmap) to a 2D array of enum instances representing whether the cell contains dirt, or air.

{% highlight rust %}
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Material {
    Air,
    Dirt,
}

// ...

pub struct Cell {
    // Removed this...
    // pub height: f64,
    // Added this...
    pub material: Material,
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then when I calculate the height of each cell on the globe, I either store `Dirt` if the cell we're looking at is below the land elevation at that point, or `Air` otherwise, and only render the cell if it contains `Dirt`.

{% highlight rust %}
let material = if height > 1.0 {
    Material::Dirt
} else {
    Material::Air
};
cells.push(Cell {
    material: material,
});
{% endhighlight %}

Here's what that looks like:

Cool! That's a good start.


## Voxels

Before we get to hexagons, I want to turn this into a proper voxmap. So I made my chunks 3D, and stored the same thing as before (`Dirt` or `Air`) at each layer. That's not much to look at yet, so I also introduced a third material type `Water` for wherever a cell is below sea level but above the land level at that point.

![Globe voxmap with z-fighting](/images/hexagons/globe-voxmap-with-z-fighting.png)

Hmmm, that's not quite what I expected. There seems to be a surprising amount of water immediately next to land, and not just on the coastline. This turned out to be what I think of as equivalent to a kind of ["z-fighting"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting). This came about because I had the sea level defined as `1.0` units from the center of the globe, and the way I was calculating the value of each cell, I would be evaluating the simplex noise at an elevation of almost exactly that same `1.0`. My understanding is that in many cells, whether or not the ocean covered the land was then determined largely by tiny floating point errors.

Changing the ocean radius slightly to something that doesn't align so inconveniently with cell centers, e.g, `1.01`, makes it look a lot better:

I think I also tweaked the colors between that screenshot and the one before, so the improvement in appearance is exaggerated. But you can clearly see that the coastline is better defined than before.


## Hexagons, at long last

In all the screenshots until now, I've been drawing each cell in my world as a quad with one corner at the nominal center of the cell, and its next opposite corner at the center of cell _(x+1, y+1)_. This means they've been both offset a bit from where they're supposed to be, and also obviously the wrong shape.

So how can I turn those quads into the hexagons I've been intending them to be all along? This is usually the point where I start scribbling on the back of envelopes (I think it was a parking fine in this case) to better understand the problem. What I came up with was a hexagon that wraps in both directions---and therefore can be tiled---positioned such that its center exists at all four corners of the quad:

{% highlight plaintext %}
(0, 0)
        ●       y
  x        ◌      ↘
  ↓     ◌     ◌
           ◌     ●
        ◌     ◌ /   ◌
           ◌   / ◌     ◌     (0, 0)
        ●─────●     ◌     ●
           ◌   \ ◌     ◌
        ◌     ◌ \   ◌     ◌
           ◌     ●     ◌
        ◌     ◌   \ ◌     ◌
           ◌     ◌ \   ◌
        ●     ◌     ●─────●
(0, 0)     ◌     ◌ /   ◌
              ◌   / ◌     ◌
                 ●     ◌
                    ◌     ◌
                       ◌
                          ●
                             (0, 0)
{% endhighlight %}

This makes it visually obvious that we're dealing with a grid of 6 units between hexagon centers (count it) to calculate cell vertex positions (assuming we want all vertices to lie at integer coordinate pairs) as opposed to the grid of 1 unit between cell centers when we're only concerned with the center points of each cell.

From there, if we list out points for the middle of each side and each vertex, starting from the middle of the side facing the positive _x_ direction and travelling counterclockwise, we end up with 12 offset coordinate pairs in this grid, labelled as follows:

{% highlight plaintext %}
               6
      7                 5
         ●─────●─────●
        /   ◌     ◌   \
       / ◌     ◌     ◌ \
   8  ●     ◌     ◌     ●  4
     /   ◌     ◌     ◌   \
    / ◌     ◌     ◌     ◌ \
9  ●     ◌     ●     ◌     ●  3
    \ ◌     ◌     ◌     ◌ /
     \   ◌     ◌     ◌   /
      ●     ◌     ◌     ●
  10   \ ◌     ◌     ◌ /   2
        \   ◌     ◌   /         y
         ●─────●─────●           ↘
     11                 1
               0

               x
               ↓
{% endhighlight %}

Referring to the top figure for the offsets and the
bottom for the labelling, that gives us:

- 0: (3, 0)
- 1: (2, 2)
- 2: (0, 3)
- 3: (-2, 4)
- 4: (-3, 3)
- 5: (-4, 2)
- 6: (-3, 0)
- 7: (-2, -2)
- 8: (0, -3)
- 9: (2, -4)
- 10: (3, -3)
- 11: (4, -2)

Plugging this in where the quads were before gives us this:

![Hexagons!](/images/hexagons/globe-with-duplicate-hexagons.png)

Yay, hexagons! But what's the deal with that line of funny star things? Those happen where a particular cell is being drawn by _two_ different chunks where they meet. Does that mean I have an off-by-one error? No---this is actually intentional. Whilst one chunk will eventually have to own the _data_ for each boundary cell (otherwise how will I know what is the authoritative state of the cell?), I'm actually intending that a chunk will render only the side of the boundary cells that fall within the bounding quad for that chunk. So eventually I'll fix this so that each chunk will render its boundary cells using, e.g., these vertices intead:

{% highlight plaintext %}
               6
      7                 5
         ◌ · · ●─────●
        ·   ◌  │  ◌   \
       · ◌     ◌     ◌ \
   8  ◌     ◌  │  ◌     ◌  4
     ·   ◌     ◌     ◌   \
    · ◌     ◌  │  ◌     ◌ \
9  ◌     ◌     ●     ◌     ●  3
    · ◌     ◌  │  ◌     ◌ /
     ·   ◌     ◌     ◌   /
      ◌     ◌  │  ◌     ◌
  10   · ◌     ◌     ◌ /   2
        ·   ◌  │  ◌   /         y
         ◌ · · ●─────●           ↘
     11                 1
               0

               x
               ↓
{% endhighlight %}

Again, that'll be easy to calculate now that we have the offset coordinates for the vertices of the hexagon, and the middle of each edge. (Were you wondering why I'd marked those edges in the diagrams above?)
