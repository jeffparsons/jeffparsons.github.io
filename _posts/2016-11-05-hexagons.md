In my last post I used Perlin noise (now switched over to simplex noise) to create some basic terrain. Here's the lumpy blob we ended up with at the end:

Let's see what I said I was going to tackle next:

> My next move will be to turn this into a proper voxmap of (mostly) hexagonal prisms, Ã  la Minecraft. Or, you know, I might lie about that again and do something else instead.

Ok, then. Let's do it! Errr, the voxels bit, I mean---not the lying.

The first thing I did was to change what I store about the globe from being a 2D array of height values (a heightmap) to a 2D array of enum instances representing whether the cell contains dirt, or air.

{% highlight rust %}
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Material {
    Air,
    Dirt,
}

// ...

pub struct Cell {
    // Removed this...
    // pub height: f64,
    // Added this...
    pub material: Material,
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then when I calculate the height of each cell on the globe, I either store `Dirt` if the cell we're looking at is below the land elevation at that point, or `Air` otherwise, and only render the cell if it contains `Dirt`.

{% highlight rust %}
let material = if height > 1.0 {
    Material::Dirt
} else {
    Material::Air
};
cells.push(Cell {
    material: material,
});
{% endhighlight %}

Here's what that looks like:

Cool! That's a good start.


## Voxels

Before we get to hexagons, I want to turn this into a proper voxmap. So I made my chunks 3D, and stored the same thing as before (`Dirt` or `Air`) at each layer. That's not much to look at yet, so I also introduced a third material type `Water` for wherever a cell is below sea level but above the land level at that point.

Hmmm, that's not quite what I expected. There seems to be a surprising amount of water immediately next to land, and not just on the coastline. This turned out to be what I think of as equivalent to a kind of ["z-fighting"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting). This came about because I had the sea level defined as `1.0` units from the center of the globe, and the way I was calculating the value of each cell, I would be evaluating the simplex noise at an elevation of almost exactly that same `1.0`. My understanding is that in many cells, whether or not the ocean covered the land was then determined largely by tiny floating point errors.

Changing the ocean radius slightly to something that doesn't align so inconveniently with cell centers, e.g, `1.01`, makes it look a lot better:

I think I also tweaked the colors between that screenshot and the one before, so the improvement in appearance is exaggerated. But you can clearly see that the coastline is better defined than before.


## Hexagons, at long last


- hexagons for cells
  - copy+paste unicode art diagrams?
  - screenshot
  - funny overlaps -> explain that I understand it
    - more unicode art diagrams
- uh oh, strange gaps
  - solution is obvious: always draw to edges
  - screenshot of fixed. yay!
  - brief description of how you'll need a copy of the neighbouring chunk's data; link off to BUGS
- render cell sides
  - picture(s)
- mention how this is all totally inefficient
  - screenshot of inside
  - describe what you're going to do to fix it
